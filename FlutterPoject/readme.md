# My First Flutter Project

Welcome to my very first Flutter project! ðŸš€  
This repository contains the code and documentation for my initial steps with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), Googleâ€™s framework for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## About

This project was created as a way to learn the basics of Flutter, including:
- Creating user interfaces with widgets
- Managing state
- Navigating between screens
- Integrating simple logic and interactivity

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or use this as inspiration for your own projects!
